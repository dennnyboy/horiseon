# Code Refactor Starter Code
After first opening the code I noticed a few different issues. 
1. The title was just "website" so it was then replaced to "Horiseon"
2.The headers span text was not formated correctly. 
3. There were no ALT attributes. 
4. The id for "search engine optimization" was missing. 
5. The CSS page was not very organized.
